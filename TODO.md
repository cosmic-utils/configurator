for libcosmic

- fix slider
- push multiple on Row and Column
- add_maybe for Setting Section
- on_press_with for button

- data path on top should remove deleted nodes
- when inserting a new node when there is already a default,
  it is not removed from the UI, whereas it should
  but it is not serialized
- for vec, same problem
- reorder array
